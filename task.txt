Here is the question:
 
 
Develop a Shopify app that subscribes to the Order Create webhook at the time of merchant installation. 
Whenever a customer places an order on the store, the app should capture the event and store only the Order ID in a database (Prisma or any database of your choice).
The app should include a Dashboard accessible to the merchant. 
When the merchant visits the dashboard, the app must retrieve the stored Order IDs from the database and query Shopify to fetch the corresponding order details, including:
Order number
Number of line items
Total amount paid by the customer
These details should be displayed in a structured table format.
 
Bonus :
Implement pagination in the Shopify app dashboard to display 10 orders per page.
